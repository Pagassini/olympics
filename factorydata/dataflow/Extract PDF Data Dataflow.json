		"description": "This dataflow takes the output from Cognitive Services and extracts the PDF information to a storage sink.\nThis specifically works with the prebuilt-read model, but you can adjust as needed. You can also save the transformations as a flowlet if you would like to reuse the logic in other dataflows. \n\nIf you choose to use other prebuilt models, please note that you may need to reimport your dataflow source schema and make some adjustments to the transformations.",
